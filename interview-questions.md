# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is a movement through a function until a certain condition is met. Once the condition is met the iteration will end. 

  Researched answer: An iteration is the execution of code repetitively until a condition is met. Iterations are typically used for strings and arrays. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The built-in method .map() takes in three predefined paramaters - value, index, and array, in that order. The value parameter is the only one required, however if you want to use the array parameter you will need to include the index parameter to get the array parameter. All parameters must be provided in the order of value, index, and array in order function properly. 

  Researched answer: The .map() function iterates through an array and must return an array of the same length, unlike filter which can return a smaller array. The built-in method .map() takes in three predefined paramaters - value, index, and array, in that order. The value parameter is the only one required, however if you want to use the array parameter you will need to include the index parameter to get the array parameter. All parameters must be provided in the order of value, index, and array in order function properly. 



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring allows developers to take an object and make it into smaller, unique variables.  

  Researched answer: Object destructuring allows developers to take properties of an object and separate them into separate variables. Object destructuring creates a path to a particular key. Several keys can be assigned to the same destructuring shortcut. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Functions are reusable code that return an output. Methods are functions that belong to an object. 

  Researched answer:Functions are reusable code that return an output. Functions allow developers to reuse code, making it generic and dynamic so that different inputs can run through the function. Methods are functions that belong to an object. Therefore, methods use "this" within the object so the code understands that the method is calling on variables within the object. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: Objects hold information like arrays. Classes are reusable collections of information. 

  Researched answer: Classes are a function that contain data and behavior. Objects hold collections of information, like arrays and other objects. An object has information and behavior and contain key value pairs.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is the practice of having certain types of code to the top of a javascript file. 

  Researched answer: Hoisting is the default practice of storing declarations at the top of a javascript file. Common declarations are var, let, and const. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: The parent-child relationship of classes inheriting information from parent classes. 

2. React: Used to create many types of code-based tools. It can be used to make small instances of code and then join a whole project together.

3. React state: An object that stores dynamic information and determine how to render the information for user experience and application/web behavior. 

4. React lifecycle methods: The lifecycle method is a means of determining the phases for developing a website or application. The lifecycle phases help to determine the amount of control and side effects the current phase has on the overall project and its implementation. 

5. DOM: DOM stands for Document Object Model is the standard for how to update and use all components within a document.
